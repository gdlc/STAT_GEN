Consider a single locus with two possible alleles (A/a).

A sample of 42 individuals reported 3 `AA` genotypes, 16 `Aa` genotypes, and 31 `aa` genotypes.

Using this data report:

  - ANS_1: the estimated frequency of the A allele,
  - ANS_2: the estimated SE of the estimated freq. of the A allele,
  - ANS_3: a 95% CI based on a normal approximation (ANS_2 must be a 2-dimensional ,vector, with lower bound and upper bound)
  - ANS_4: same as ANS_3, in this case using an exact method (hint: consider using `binom.test()`)
