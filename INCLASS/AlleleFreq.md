Consider a single locus with two possible alleles (A/a).

A sample of 50 individuals reported 3 `AA` genotypes, 16 `Aa` genotypes, and 31 `aa` genotypes.

Using this data report:

  - **ANS_1**: The estimated frequency of the A allele.
  - **ANS_2**: The SE of the estimated freq. of the A allele.
  - **ANS_3**: A 95% CI based on a normal approximation (ANS_2 must be a 2-dimensional vector).
  - **ANS_4**: Same as ANS_3, in this case using an exact method (hint: consider using `binom.test()`)
