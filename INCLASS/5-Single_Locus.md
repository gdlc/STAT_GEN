The file has two tables. You will work with this file and submit the file. Your first answer will be the first table. 
Your second answer will be the second table. You will submit this Excel file to Gradescope. 
Make sure not to modify the file name or extension (do not update to xlsx), otherwise R will not find the file. 

The file provides a frequency for the allele A, so pA=Prob(A), and pB = Prob(B) = 1-pA, assuming the locus is biallelic (e.g., The only polymorphism possible are the A or B alleles on that position).

1) Fill in the first table (gray area). Calculating the genoype frequency assuming HWE. The sum of P, H, and Q sould be 1, verify that in row 7. 
2) Fill in the second table (gray area). Calculate the expected value and variance of G, then, calculate the 'a' and 'd' values.

## Submission to Gradescope

  For your submission to Gradescope provide the Excel file named `assignment.xls` (lower case in the name, and lower case the extension) answering the questions shown above. 
  You may submit your answer to Gradescope as many times as needed.
