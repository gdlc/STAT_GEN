1) **Download the Excel file, available at**: 

[Single_Locus_Exercise](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/x5e3ops1bighadl0qucd0/assignment.xls?rlkey=elo8dzcroesig9ylz7q1rqf1w&st=3w3fwzol&dl=0)


The file provides a frequency for the allele A, so pA=Prob(A), and pB = Prob(B) = 1-pA, assuming the locus is biallelic (e.g., The only polymorphism possible are the A or B alleles on that position) as well as the genetic value for each genotype class (colum labeled as G in the top table).


2) **Fill the empty cells of top table (grey area)**.
     - Calculating the genoype frequency assuming HWE. The sum of proportions of the AA, AB, and BB sould be 1, verify that in row 7.
     - Compute the information needed to compute the average genetic value (column Freq.X value) and the average squared value (column F).

3) **Fill the empty cells of the bottom table**
     - E[G]
     - Var[G]
     - a
     - d

4) **Save the file* as assignment.xls (do not update to xlsx, otherwise the grader will fail to read it) named `assigment.xls` **and submit it**.

The grader will check on a number of points (one per blank column of the top table) and one per empty cell in the bottom table.
