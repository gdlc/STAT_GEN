In this inclass assigment you will need to compute the expected value, the variance, additive effect, and dominance deviation for a single locus under HWE.


1) **Download [this Excel file](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/3o2vglpkriq3qfdrjkt4v/assignment.xls?rlkey=vjuwf4nxo303d6m22fxpg9m6s&dl=0)**


The file provides the frequency for allele A (the locus is bi-allelic).


2) **Fill the empty cells of the table (grey area)**.

3) Create an R-script named `assignment.R`

```r
 ANS=list(
          EXPECTED_VALUE=NA,
          VAR=NA,
          a=NA,
          d=NA
     )

```

4) Fill the NA values in the list with the values you obtained in the excel file.

5) Submit `assignment.R`
