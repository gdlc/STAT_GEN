Consider a single locus with two possible alleles (A/a).

A sample of 500 individuals reported 30 `AA` genotypes, 160 `Aa` genotypes, and 310 `aa` genotypes.

Using this data, calculate and report the following results:

  - **ANS_1**: Observed count of the 'AA', 'Aa' and 'aa' genotypes in a 3 by 1 vector. Use the 'AA', 'Aa' and 'aa' as the names of the vector. 
  - **ANS_2**: Allele frequencies for alleles 'A' and 'a', resectively. Answer 2 is a 2 by 1 vector, with names 'p' and 'q', respectively.
  - **ANS_3**: Expected count of 'AA', 'Aa' and 'aa' genotypes under HWE, in a 3 by 1 vector.
  - **ANS_4**: Chi-Sq p-Value testing the gene A for HWE.
